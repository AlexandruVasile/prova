backend notes:

db.js: Manages database connections and configurations. This file might include logic to connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and export a connection object that can be used throughout the application.

docker-compose.yml: Used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. In this case, it could be setting up containers for the application server and possibly a database, making it easy to deploy the entire backend with a single command.

eslint.config.mjs: Configuration for ESLint, which enforces code style and best practices across the project. The .mjs extension indicates this might use ES modules, so ESLint settings are likely set up to support this projectâ€™s JavaScript/TypeScript structure.

package.json: Contains metadata for the project, such as scripts to run and dependencies the project relies on. This is essential for managing dependencies through npm.

package-lock.json and pnpm-lock.yaml: Lock files for npm and pnpm respectively, which capture exact dependency versions for consistent installs. It seems like both npm and pnpm are used to manage dependencies, which may indicate experimentation with or a migration between package managers.

server.js: The main entry point of the application where the server is initialized. Here, middleware, routes, and other configurations are likely applied, and the server is started to listen for incoming requests.
